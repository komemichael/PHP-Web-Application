			<p>Hi my name is Alex, but some people call me Wilke. I worked at camp this summer and got a lot of work done. I outfitted a boat with lights so that it is not invisible at night. The other camp staff would have liked for me to remain at camp for longer, so that I could have continued to set up their new communications systems and also work in the kitchen, but I had to return to go to school. I also stocked some shelves and helped customers with ease and expertise at my part-time job in the city. On the side I enjoy watching movies as long as I have not seen them before and occasionally drinking Dr. Pepper.</p>
			<p>I am still working on finding the optimal heat setting at which to fry eggs on the new stove. On the previous one, I was 95% confident that a setting between 4 and 5, closer to the 5 (maybe about 4.75) was ideal, but this new stove has not been around long enough to get enough samples, although I do fry eggs at a rate of 11 per week.</p>
			<p>I'm not going to share a photo here, but I will say that this segment would be more interesting if there was a photo here.</p>
