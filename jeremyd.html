			<p>Hello, my name is Jeremy Dyck. I am passionate about helping people achieve their goals, particularly when they involve helping them start small businesses. My crew and I have helped determined individuals launch a variety of interesting ventures over the past few months, including the first ever unhackable website. Once I finish my schooling I will likely be able to take on more meaningful projects.</p>

			<p>I am trying to improve my sight-singing, so that less valuable time has to be spent on practicing and more time can be invested in listening to podcasts and working out.</p>

			<p>"I was once lost, but now I am found. I was once missing, and apparently I am still missing."</p>

			<p>"So, I was listening to a podcast..." -Jeremy Dyck
