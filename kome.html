			<p>Hi my name is kome and I like pizza and learning new stuff, a veriety of stuff actually from art to science and math and music. I do like learning a bunch of information because if I have learnt a few things from my life, its that majority of the information you get is crucial for heathy living. That includes how you respond to people, situations or triggers.</p>

			<p>I do like pizza though, not too much pizza. Just in moderation. Everything in moderation. The plan is to get as close to the maximum utility but not there. It's like that is where things are undefined. Think derivatives. I also don't make complete sense sometimes because my words are sometimes not enough to articulate my thoughts. If you think of it more, you will notice the sense.</p>
